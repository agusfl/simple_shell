# Simple Shell project - Tester for Holberton

This is a simple implementation of tests for our own version of a **shell** for a linux system.

## Environment 
* Shell Script
* Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Execution Permissions: Needed --> chmod u+x

## How to Use it:

Firts of all, clone this repo with the next command: ```git clone https://github.com/Nachop51/shell_tests.git```
Then run this command, ```gcc -g -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh```
Once you do that just type ```sh tests.sh```
Finally compare the "Correct Output" with "Your Output", both outputs should be the same.
