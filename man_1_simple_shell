NAME
       hsh â€” shell, our implementation of a UNIX standard command line interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       hsh [-options]...[comand_string | file]

DESCRIPTION
       The hsh is our implementation of a command language interpreter that shall
       execute commands read from a command line string, the standard
       input, or a specified file.
       This shell is based on the original UNIX shell written by Ken Thompson.

COMMANDS
       Our hsh version support the commands that are determined in the PATH environmental
       variable. In PATH is specified the directories to be searched to find a command.
       Arguments for the commands are supported.

BUILT INS
       exit - If you type: exit --> in the interactive mode it allows you to exit the shell.
       env - If you type: env --> the environmental variables will be listed.

SIGNALS
       ctrl + c - This signal was set to be ignored.
       ctrl + d - This signal was set to exit the shell.

INVOCATION
       hsh shell can be run in interactive mode or in non interactive mode. In the interactive mode
       a prompt ($) will appear for the user tu execute a command and this will be repeated until
       the exit command is used or if the user press ctrl + d. In the non interactive mode you can
       send the output of a command as an input to the ./hsh program with the | pipe command.

EXAMPLE
       Interactive mode: first you need to execute the hsh program --> ./hsh
       Once your are running the program type: ls
       This will show you the list of files or directories that you have in your current directory.
       After this the prompt --> $ will appear again until you type the exit command or hit ctrl + d.

       Non interactive mode:
       Type: echo "ls" | ./hsh
       This will show you the same that was explained for the interactive mode but in a non interactive
       way.
